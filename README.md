## CFSMetaModel4R 
An R package allowing the fitting of meta-models from existing tree-level models

It allows running tree-level simulations on 

- Artemis-2009 (through the CAPSIS platform)
- Open Stand Model (OSM)
- Forest Vegetation Simulation, British-Columbia variant (FVS-BC)

These models are called and the simulations are run through HTTP requests. 

This R package depends on the J4R package and includes the repicea-metaModel Java library, which allows the fitting of the meta-models.
