## CFSMetaModel4R 

An R package allowing the fitting of meta-models.

## Introduction

This package makes it possible to fit meta-models. Simulations with tree- or plot-level models must have been carried out. 
Their simulation results can be stored in MetaModel java instances through the J4R package. Once all the simulations are done
and added to the MetaModel instance, then the meta-model can be fitted.
